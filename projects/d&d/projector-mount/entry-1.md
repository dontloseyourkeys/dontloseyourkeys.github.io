## Entry 1: Designing a projector mount
#### Sunday, October 13th, 2024

Today I got inspired to work on my projects again. It's thanksgiving long weekend, so lots of time right now. I've been feeling a tad socially disconnected lately, and so I really want D&D to start running again. I'm not the DM, so I can't get the campaign prepared myself, but since we're roommates, I can do all of the fun semi related setup. At the very least, it's an excuse to start on a cool project.
