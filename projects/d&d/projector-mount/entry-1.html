<h2>Entry 1: Designing a projector mount</h2>
<h4>Sunday, October 13th, 2024</h4>

<p>Today I got inspired to work on my projects again. It's thanksgiving long weekend,
     so lots of time right now. I've been feeling a tad socially disconnected lately, and so I really want D&amp;D to start running again. I'm not the DM, so I can't get the campaign prepared myself, but since we're roommates, I can do all of the fun semi-related setup. At the very least, it's an excuse to start on a cool project.</p>
<p>I haven't started this project at all yet, so there is a lot to be done. I want to make it so that we can use the plain white table for d&d, with projection down straight onto it. It can't be from an angle, or the players on the side from which its projecting will block part of the map. I intend to use the wall mounted tv stand that came with my unit, along with an adapter that I'll design, to mount the projector such that it's directly above the table.
