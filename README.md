## New Project Log: Minecraft Server

I figured it may be fun to set up a page for my projects, which is something I've seen other engineering student do as proof they have a life outside school. Today marks the start of a new project, or rather version 2.0 of an existing project. I picked up a new computer today, the first desktop PC I've ever owned. It is intended to be my new dedicated server computer. Right now the main goal is to get the port forwarding set up correctly to run my minecraft server, which previously ran on a 2014 iMac. (Not the best for a server) Sadly, that one died a slow demise as the computer began to fail to write chunks to the disk, and would keep regenerating them from scratch instead, probably because it was also being used as the family kitchen computer and it never (NEVER :( ) would get powered down or restarted. 

I'm going to be starting the file organization and backend from scratch, as I've learned a lot about how servers actually work since when I originally made the server. I originally had followed a tutorial to the letter in 2020, so I did not even know what was going on with my own server when I first made it. I've learned a lot about what port forwarding actually is, and computers and code in general, so things should go much more smoothly the second time around. I should be able to import the old world and player data once I have the backend running. Once I have it running successfully on LAN, I'll move onto port forwarding. I'll keep you posted once the task at hand is complete.

The first problem I've encountered is that I no longer had the correct items. After a quick check of who was affected by this issue (just me) I set about fixing it. This was a relatively simple fix, and what I ended up doing was just replacing all my player data with files copied from a slightly older backup. I believe when I tried to open the world in singleplayer over the summer, it rewrote my data from scratch, since I wasn't logging on thru multiplayer. I kept the world data as recent as possible, and I'm pleased to say everything has returned to where it should be! What a relief. 

The next issue that arose was with trying to log into the router to set up the port forwarding. I tried to login with the admin password printed on the router to no avail. It simply did not work, even when I tried to reset the credentials with said admin password. I'm going to take a break from this and try again tomorrow when I can call them.
