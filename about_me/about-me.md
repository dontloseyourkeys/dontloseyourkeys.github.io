### Hello! You have found my website!

I'm Asia Beard, a 3rd year mechanical engineering student and self-professed nerd. This is my website where I'll be chronicling my active personal projects. Hopefully I'll get it looking like a proper portfolio someday.

I started this page as both motivation to work on my projects more consistently, and as a cool way of tracking my progress to inform my future endeavors. I hope you enjoy!
